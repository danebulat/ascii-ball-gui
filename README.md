# ASCII Ball GUI

## Overview

An ASCII text animation wrapped in a GUI rendered by OpenGL via the 
[Monomer](https://github.com/fjvallarino/monomer) library. The 
application is written in pure Haskell.

The GUI provides controls to adjust the animation area (frame size)
and velocity values. See screenshots below!

## Building and Running

Simply build and run the application using Stack. See the requested 
GHC resolver in `stack.yaml` and application dependencies in 
`package.yaml`.

```bash 
stack build 
stack run
```
